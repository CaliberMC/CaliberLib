Caliber Lib is a library mod containing various aspects of all of my mods. It is available for other developers to use 
for integration with CaliberMC mods or for use on their own projects as well!  Caliber Lib does nothing on its own and 
will be a required dependency for most of my mods as well as some other developers mods.

If anyone is interested in contributing to this mod by coding or resource pack creation, please reach out to Charm8er on our discord.
