Caliber Lib is a library mod containing various aspects of all of my mods. It is available for other developers to use for integration with CaliberMC mods or for use on their own projects as well! Caliber Lib does nothing on its own and will be a required dependency for most of my mods as well as some other developers mods.

Keep in mind, this is back to Alpha stages with the latest 1.0.0 update and not all features have been added to the mod. Upon release of new versions, additional features will be added and I will do my best not to break anyexisting ones. Most features included in the library will be here to stay. I look forward to providing a bug free and highly useable survival friendly mod for everyone to use. If you have any ideas or feature suggestions please let me know in the comments or on the issues/feature request page on github.

Keep this library bookmarked because it will be in development for a long time to come.
